## ðŸ“œ Overview  
This repository presents a **multiobjective optimization framework** for automotive crashworthiness design, addressing the challenges of high nonlinearities in vehicle crash simulations. The methodology integrates surrogate modeling and evolutionary algorithms to optimize vehicle weight, acceleration characteristics, and toe-board intrusion during frontal collisions. Designed for automotive engineers and researchers, this framework enables efficient exploration of Pareto-optimal solutions under full frontal and 40% offset-frontal crash conditions.
